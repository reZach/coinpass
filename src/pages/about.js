                        <p>Hi, my name is Zachary, and this is a side project I felt inspired to make. This project is an amalgamation of my personality, life experience, interests, hobbies and inspirations that came together in a way I'm very excited about. I wanted to create this page to serve as deeper explanation of the project as a whole, and serve as inspiration that no matter your interests or life experiences, there are certainly ways to feel fulfilled working on side projects no matter what life experiences, interests, or opportunities you may have.</p>

                        <p>If I look to my past, it is clear to me that the way I show love to others is through <a href="https://5lovelanguages.com/learn">acts of service</a>. I've done so many different acts of service; making study guides, teaching/mentoring, donating my time and money, building websites, cooking meals for others, and many other things across the years. I say this not to consider myself any better than anyone else, by no means, but to call out that the way we feel most energized to care for others can take many forms. I will regularly do smaller acts of service towards others, but at times I feel inspired to create or build projects that impact more people than a single individual.</p>

                        <p>It must be said that alongside these acts of service that I enjoy doing, through much life experience and time invested learning, I  greatly value and acknowledge the importance of others' emotions. A large importance to me when interacting with others is to be cognizant and read the emotional needs of another person. A single action, whether positive or negative, can have such a large impact on someone's day or beyond. I had such an interaction that greatly changed the perspective I had in my life and it was solely because of someone else respecting and valuing my emotional needs that this was able to happen.</p>

                        <p>The very beginnings of this idea were planted in my head after watching the 2023 movie, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21191906/">After Death</a>. After Death is a movie about near death experiences and testimony from individuals who have researched them, or the people who have experienced these firsthand. One of the women in the film was sharing her testimony that when she died and was brought to Heaven, God showed her how her actions impacted people far beyond who she thought were impacted. I was very intrigued with that idea, but nothing took form from that thought until recently.</p>

                        <p>After I started therapy for my anxiety, I was (eventually) introduced to fidget toys, and I found a <a href="https://meta-edc.com/products/acedc-full-size-haptic-coin?variant=45332623425830">haptic coin</a> that has really helped me. I really am attached to this coin, and it was during this same time I was feeling inspired to do something larger (an act of service) for a large group of people. I took my inspiration from the After Death movie and this desire to give to others is what settled and became what we have here today: the Good Samaritan Movement.</p>

                        <p>I've placed the words: "As I have loved you, so you must love one another" (John 13:34) as a reminder on the coin to love others as Jesus loved us. Jesus obeyed the will of God out of love for us, and because of that, he gave his life for us. In Catholic teaching, we too are called to give our lives for others. No one wishes crucifixion or death on another, but in other ways we find we can give our lives to another. If you are married, you give your life to your spouse and to your family. If you are single, you give your life to those around you. If you are consecrated to religious life, you give your life to God and the Church. It's from this self-giving of ourselves that we truly find what life is meant for.</p>

                        <p>I hope to inspire your love for neighbor and the positive impact you can have in more lives than you realize.</p>

                        <p><em>To the one who changed the course of my life, @SeaStar, thank you</em></p>
