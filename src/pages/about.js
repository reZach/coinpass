                        <p>Hi, my name is Zachary, and this is a side project I felt inspired to make. This project is an amalgamation of my personality, life experience, interests, hobbies and inspirations that came together in a way I'm very excited about. I wanted to create this page to serve as deeper explanation of the project as a whole, and serve as inspiration that no matter your interests or life experiences, there are certainly ways to feel fulfilled working on side projects no matter what life experiences, interests, or opportunities you may have.</p>

                        <p>If I look to my past, it is clear to me that the way I show love to others is through <a href="https://5lovelanguages.com/learn">acts of service</a>. I've done so many different acts of service taking many forms; making study guides, teaching/mentoring, donating my time and money, building websites, cooking meals for others, and many other things across the years. I say this not to consider myself any better than anyone else, but to call out that the way we feel most energized to care for others can take many forms. I will regularly do smaller acts of service towards others, but at times I feel inspired to create or build projects that impact more people than a single individual.</p>

                        <p>Due to the time I've invested, my interest, and a natural ability to notice details, I've become very passionate about emotional intelligence and the importance of emotion in our everyday lives. I see and truly believe that the quality of our relationships have a profound impact on the quality of our life. The smallest of actions can have a large positive, or negative impact, on our lives. It is this interest that complements my desire to serve others that I frequently look to find ways to serve others that would benefit them emotionally as well as temporally.</p>

                        <p>In 2023, the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt21191906/">After Death</a> was released, and as someone who is Catholic, the story of the woman who shared that when she died and went to heaven to be judged before God, she was shown how her actions during life affected many beyond she thought was possible, planted the seeds in my mind the idea for this project, but I didn't know it at the time.</p>

                        <p>This project lay idle in my unconscious until the ball was set in motion when I started going to therapy for my anxiety. As part of therapy, which I  would recommend to anyone who feels they need help in any way, I was suggested to use fidget toys. I ended up finding a <a href="https://meta-edc.com/products/acedc-full-size-haptic-coin?variant=45332623425830">haptic coin</a> which has been a real game changer for me. (I would recommend <a href="https://fluxx-design.com/collections/indx">this haptic coin</a> if you want a haptic coin at work - it is silent!). I became attached to using this haptic coin, which got my brain wanting to incorporate a coin in this "project" I wanted to create. I originally thought to incorporate the idea of a collectible coin with the community of a now-popular video game by Arrowhead Game Studios that I had been playing. The more I sat on the idea, the more I lost interest that idea, and I pivoted to taking this opportunity to evangelize my faith with the project.</p>

                        <p>As a Catholic, or any follower of Jesus, there is a calling to tell others <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Mark%2016%3A15">the story of the Gospel</a>, and while I do see the importance of this, my personal experience that inspired me to love others (and find my faith) as I try my best to do now, was first seen through the selfless actions of love from others. It is in this same vein that I hope this project inspires others to show love, care and concern for people that transforms their lives. I think it is in these ordinary moments that we can see the same love Jesus has for us through how others show love towards us.</p>

                        <p>Each action that is logged on the website gets a pin added to the map, so we can get perhaps a small glimpse what awaits us at the end of our Earthly life. I hope seeing the map of pins inspires you that your very one act of love towards another has a ripple effect much further beyond what you can even imagine.</p>

                        <p><em>Thank you for being that inspiration for me, @SeaStar</em></p>
